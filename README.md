# GhissuBot
An "open-domain" conversational chatbot powered by a sequence-to-sequence RNN with Attention paired with a CNN for encoding
conversational context. Developed with two dear friends plus help from the Google seq2seq project (https://github.com/google/seq2seq).

Until this is cleaned up, peruse the paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10520.pdf
